,,,,,,,,,,,,,Methodology,,
Project Goal(s) and Supporting Objectives â€“,,,,,,,,,,,,,Waterfall,,
The overarching goal of this project is to provide B&B Manufacturing with a secure and reliable networking architecture with room for future growth.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Requirements,,this is what they have and what they need
,,,,,,,,,,,,,design,,designing the new vlans ip address and dchp pools
Phases ,,,,,,,,,,,,,implementation,,the actual install on equipment
phase 1:,,,,,,,,,,,,,verification,,this is the testin gpart I mentioned from part 1
I will conduct a site survery preforming an inventory and a discovery on how the network is utilized.,,,"< - -  Utilize this in changes in project envronment, like how the network is used",,,,,,,,,,maintenance,,clean up cables
Phase 2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 2 will requiring using findings from phase 1 to determine what equipment and resourses will be needed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Phase 3 will began the implementation phase where systems will be installed and configured,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phase 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
phase 4 will be the test and evaluation phase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Goals and objectives table,the only goal is the upgrade,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Objective 1 site survery, discovery on how what is used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
not sure how to detail this out maybe notes if deliverable is needed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"objective 2 purchase hardware identiifed for replacement , need to remove juniper from list as it adds fluff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
objective 3 - establish new networks vlans and dhcp pools  - this will be a deliverable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
objective 4 - network testing - this also will be a delverable item if I can fake it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Objective 5 - I put go live but this means install stuff, this will present a diagram as deliverable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
