### Ideas for paper:
why not dell ?
terrible 802.1x implementaion
https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/data-center-and-cloud-networking/compare/cisco-vs-dell-technologies

“Segmenting a network also leads to better performance due to less congestion. With fewer hosts per subnet, a segmented network minimizes local traffic and reduces the “noise” in broadcast traffic”

why not arista?


Why not juniper?

802.1x network for wifi and group accounts drip feeder etc?
shipping scanners dont login - vlan wifi these only with acls to talk to erp system

touchscreens don't login either 
cameras dont login
AC systems (atlas copco)

production vlan?
thin clients and fat clients

the why:
(future) phone system addon
network segmentaion 
printers on on basic print server need a vlan and suggest a vm for this job instead of erp server
network is a flat 10.0.0.0/8
possible security threats
ac system could access HR computer ac system is connected to the internet for vendor Health monitoring
workgroup (non-managed switch could malfuntion (happened in the past) or incorreclty connected to itelf and bring the network down

why is this upgraded needed?
add missing security features 
addd support for future ip phone system (vendor nutral changes)
