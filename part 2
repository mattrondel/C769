Proposal Overview 
B&B Manufacturing is a medium sized company of 275 employees located in Valencia, CA. The company consists of 5 adjacent buildings including administration, assembly, manufacturing and maintenance. (Authors note:  bldg. 1 and 2 will be mfg, bldg. 5 maintenance,  2 admin, and 3 assembly) Their network is a mix of multi-vendor hardware that lacks standardization, network separation and it includes equipment that has been deemed end of life from the manufacturer. Since the Biden Administration has pushed to bring more manufacturing jobs back to America the company has seen tremendous growth and because of this employees have made several complaints pertaining to slow connections to on premise resources such as file stores ERP system and Wi-Fi.  Along with this growth the company has also stated they want to replace an aging phone system with an IP based one.
As a former employee turned managed service provider (MSP) I was chosen to assist with documenting, proposing, standardizing, procuring, upgrading the network infrastructure. This process included creating a network diagram of the current network infrastructure, discussing future technology with upper management and on-site IT staff suggesting future expansion such as the desired IP phone system, then proposing and installing a solution that will meet both requirements from a single manufacturer. Once the network design and equipment list were approved, the company would requests bids from approved vendors to purchase and installation would take place to install and configure the new network equipment.
	This project began with interviewing the on-site IT staff and upper management to determine the needs and expectations of the network, as well as discussing future growth of the company and IP phone system requirements. While these interviews took place, notes of the existing infrastructure was taken and network topology mapping software was used to probe the existing network to confirm (trust but verify) along with physical inspections for adequate cooling and power, along with fiber connections between buildings. At this time , the fiber optic cabling that connects the five buildings were tested and verified to see if it could handle the proposed new network equipment’s transmissions speeds (authors note the connection between 2 and 3 is no good and new lines need to be redone/retrenched
Phase 2 of the project consisted of designing the network, including the new IP address schemes and VLANS

Since the Biden Administration has pushed to bring more manufacturing jobs back to America the company has seen tremendous growth and because of this employees have made several complaints pertaining to slow connections to on premise resources such as file stores ERP system and wifi. Along with growth the company has also stated they want to replace an aging phone system with an IP based one. -- >
Outside of minor repairs such as a defective unit or cable B&B’s existing network has not seen any changes for over 13 years. B&B is a spread across 5 adjacent buildings with primary servers in one building and network equipment in another. Upon inspection several obsolete HP procurve 1810G unmanged switches were found as the “main network” backbone” as the local IT called it along with numerious Linksys SG300 power over Ethernet (POE) switches used for IPsecuirty cameras. Also worth metioning the air condtioning stsmes in all 5 building are sharing the same network. For their firewall .. maybe not this tz-104? Move this

The Proposal Overview section (suggested length of 2–4 pages) introduces the problem and overviews the solution. It contains the "road map" for the rest of the paper. First, describe the problem the project addresses and then provide an overview of the project and the paper's organization. Finally, summarize the capstone's highlights. Include the following in your summary:
The proposed 
A.1 Problem Summary

●	Any citable work produced by an industry professional is acceptable, e.g., whitepaper, online articles, manuals, videos, etc. 
●	The work only needs to relate to an aspect of your project, e.g., applied technology, a methodology used, risks, benefits, costs, etc.

Review of work 4
Start with an overview of the article, including the work's title and an in-text citation, and summarize the major points discussed. Describe how the work relates to the proposed development of the project (in fulfillment of part B1). 

C. Project Rationale

●	View Writing the Rationale and Current Environment Sections.
-this is based on the past , no right or wrong only the need to offere sufficient support. Usually rooted in business, tchical or user needs. No right or wrong only one that makes sense
Summaries should include the rationale for choosing this project, including what makes this problem interesting or significant. The Project Rationale section (suggested length of 1–2 pages) provides a rationale for the project. It should address the reasons for implementing the project, as described in the Proposal Overview. The rationale may include and expand on business and technical reasons to support the implementation. Justify the selection of the project.

D. Current Project Environment
●	View Writing the Rationale and Current Environment Sections.
Upon site survey discovered obsoitie HP procurve and Linksys Power over Ethernet (POE) swtiches
-This is based on the present. Thisis describing how things currently work, whats wrong with the current system of state of affairs , then the proposed solution and how it addreeeses whats wrong. Don’t assume how the reader will understand how this will fix things. Tell them how including what problems might arise with the solution and what long term impacts we might resonaly expect potential problems and expectations are an excellent thing to include.
This section (suggested length of 2–3 pages) describes and details the current project environment. It should also address specifically how the current state will set the direction for the definition and implementation of the proposed solution. Include other details that support the description as needed to support and briefly define the project environment. Analyze the systems and describe the status of the project environment before the project begins. 

E. Methodology

●	View Writing the Methodology, Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Sections.
This section (suggested length of 1–2 pages) describes the specific methodology. The methodology is the process that the project will fill when implemented. Include specific details to adequately describe the steps that will take place to execute the project entirely. Explain how your standard methodology (such as ADDIE or SDLC) will apply to the implementation of the project.
●	Identify the standard methodology used. 
●	Directly connect steps taken in your process to development phases of the standard methodology, e.g., analysis, design, etc.

F. Project Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables
●	View Writing the Methodology, Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Sections.
In Project Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables (suggested length of 3–5 pages), provide a detailed explanation of the goals and objectives for the project and explain what the project will provide. There should be a specific identification of each goal and objective and a clear and logical description with adequate detail. Address and explain the criteria used to measure the objectives to demonstrate how each goal and objective is measured. The project will include a formal report. In addition, it will likely have a technical IT product, a user's manual, or other documentation. Deliverables should provide a detailed logical explanation of the project to substantiate the work and completion. Include the following in the description: 
F1. Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Table

Finally, define the goals, objectives, and deliverables that align with the Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables Table.

G.	Project Timeline with Milestones
●	View Writing the Timeline and Outcomes Sections.
This section (suggested length of 1–2 pages) provides a projected timeline with milestones for the project. These may be estimates that will most likely be adjusted, as the project will often require adjustments during the development and implementation phases. 
●	Include a narrative describing each milestone.
●	Include a table (as below) with projected milestones, duration, start, and end dates. Projections should be as authentic as possible without regard to academic plans. Dates from task 2 must be in the future, and dates from task 3 must be in the past -they do not need to align.
