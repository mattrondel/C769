Proposal Overview 
B&B Manufacturing is a medium sized company of 275 employees located in Valencia, CA. The company consists of 5 adjacent buildings including administration, assembly, manufacturing and maintenance. (Authors note:  bldg. 1 and 2 will be mfg, bldg. 5 maintenance, 2 admin, and 3 assembly) Their network is a mix of multi-vendor hardware that lacks standardization, network separation and it includes equipment that has been deemed end of life from the manufacturer. Since the Biden Administration has pushed to bring more manufacturing jobs back to America the company has seen tremendous growth and because of this employees have made several complaints pertaining to slow connections to on premise resources such as file stores ERP system and Wi-Fi.  Along with this growth the company has also stated they want to replace an aging phone system with an IP based one.
As a former employee turned managed service provider (MSP) I was chosen to assist with documenting, proposing, standardizing, procuring, and upgrading the network infrastructure. This process included creating a network diagram of the current network infrastructure, discussing future technology with upper management and on-site IT staff suggesting future expansion such as the desired IP phone system, then proposing and installing a solution that will meet both requirements from a single manufacturer. Once the network design and equipment list were approved, the company would requests bids from approved vendors to purchase and installation would take place to install and configure the new network equipment.
	This project began with interviewing the on-site IT staff and upper management to determine the needs and expectations of the network, as well as discussing future growth of the company and IP phone system requirements. While these interviews took place, notes of the existing infrastructure was taken and network topology mapping software was used to probe the existing network to confirm logical topology. Physical inspections of adequate cooling and power, along with fiber connections between buildings. 
At this time , the fiber optic cabling that connects the five buildings were tested and verified to see if it could handle the proposed new network equipment’s transmissions speeds (authors note the connection between 2 and 3 is no good and new lines need to be redone/retrenched). 
Phase 2 of the project consisted of designing the network, including the new IP address schemes and VLANS, and compiling a finalized list of equipment for each building and location. Once this list was complete, it was emailed to various suppliers for pricing for a request for quote (RFQ) during a waiting period of two weeks for best pricing. After a two week period of pricing had ended quotes were evaluated and supplier was selected. Once the supplier was selected and scope of work was determined, the equipment was ordered.
Phase 3 (authors note swap out these phases if they don’t align with task 1 paper) began with receiving, verifying and configuring the new equipment. The new equipment was powered up and configured at the administration building and installed at the corresponding building locations. 
The process was carried out one building at a time beginning with the core of the network - Building 2 main distribution frame (MDF) then progressing to each intermediate distribution frame (IDF) within the building. Throughout this document, the main distribution frame (MDF) refers to the central connection point for each of the buildings to the rest of the network and IDFs refers to the smaller network closets within the buildings across the corporate campus. The justification for this approach was that it minimized the downtime of each of the buildings and any problems that might arise could be addressed without affecting the rest of the company. (Problem isolation?).

Review of Other work
Migrating and standardizing on a manufacturer for network equipment simplifies the administration and reduces network management overhead. During this process, extensive research was done to search for advice, tips and similar outcomes to gauge the success of the project. According to Cisco’s_ best practice guide, it is recommended best practice to deploy a two tier network architecture design or also referred to as leaf and spine because of ____ (Cisco, date). The two tear network or leaf/spine consists of ___. The leaf layer is the first tier of the campus where end user devices such as computers, printers, phones, IP-based cameras connect to the network. The spine or core (?) is where the heart of the network where servers and network storage devices reside. 
	After the physical design of the network was completed, it was time to design the logical layout.  The original network was a flat network meaning it had no IP address security segmentation or Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). A VLAN is a logical group of workstations, servers, and network devices ___ definition from an article hopefully find how VLANs help with network traffic or speed (Cisco, DATE). Authors note check out business routers article-
It was determined that B&B would benefit greatly by creating VLANs for similar devices and groups such as servers, IP-based cameras, shop, guests, IT management and the future IP-based phones. Per Cisco’s best practices article “Create a “Dead End” VLAN for Unused Ports”(Cisco, 2020) recommendation the default VLAN would be changed and a “dead-end” VLAN would be created to place unused ports in until they are needed. Access control lists (ACLs) would be created as well to either permit or deny access to resources such as printers, servers or devices with confidential information.
	After the information was gathered for the physical and logical design of the new network it was time to look into prioritizing and routing traffic. Since B and B had expressed interest in upgrading to an IP-based phone system in the future it was extremely important to incorporate this into the network design. VoIP calls can be prone to jitter, latency, and packet loss issues which lead to bad audio quality, network congestion, missed or jumbled audio, dropped calls, etc. And for any business, this is a major issue because it interferes with your teams’ ability to offer uninterrupted service.(United World Telecom, 2021)

Current Project Environment
	B&B manufacturing had a very fundamental setup. Within Building 2, in the MDF there was 3 NETGEAR unmanaged 24 port JFS524 10/100 switches serving as the “core network”. An unmanaged switch comes with a fixed configuration and do not allow any changes to their configuration. Managed switch allows for better control, prioritization, of network traffic. Attached to one of these switches was a Linksys SRW2024 power-over-Ethernet (POE) switch connected to the IP-cameras. This same switch had a cat 5 cable going underground via conduit to building 3. On another of the NETGEAR switches there was a post-it note taped on both ends labeled “to building rear IDF”. On the lowest of the NETGEAR stack, a SonicWALL NSA 220 Firewall was found connected to the internet service provider’s modem. All of these connections were connected via 100 Mbps (megabits per second). In the rear of building 2 found in the IDF there was two more NETGEAR switches connected together with cat 5 cable and another Linksys POE switch for cameras. One of these NETGEAR switches had a 100 Mbps (megabits per second) cat 5 cable going underground through conduit to Building 1. In Building 1’s MDF there was 3 more NETGEAR switches along with 1 of the same Linksys POE switches. One of the NETGEAR switches went out to two IDFs and another going through underground conduit to building 4 and then to two IDFs within its building. Each IDF contained the same number of switches found in the MDF. In building 4 was a direct copy of build 1 with the same number of devices in each IDF and MDFs. Exploring Building 3, 3 more NETGEAR and 1 Linksys POE was found along with a conduit to building 5. Once again building 5 contained the same quantity and manufacturer of switches all connected via the same speed of 100 Mbps. Although this equipment was still functioning, the network was fully saturated and running as capacity and could not keep up with the volume of devices and growth over the last few years.
The current network design was a flat network with no IP segmentation or security. The problem with this setup that if a broadcast packet is sent out from an end device in building 1, that broadcast packet is sent to every building and network device connected to the network. One of the issues in the past the On-site IT staff mentioned is that they had experienced a network loop and had crashed the company network and taken it down for a few days. A network loop is caused when a patch cable gets plugged in from one network port directly to another. This causes the packets to reflect back to the source in which locks up the switch.
The issue with lack of network segmentation is that when a customer or supplier joins the network to do a presentation any malicious software or virus that could be present on their computer could inflect the entire company. 


The new equipment installed in building 2 consists of 5 Cisco POE switches configured in a stack configuration. Some network switches have the ability to be connected to other switches and operate together as a single unit. These configurations are called stacks. Stacking shows the characteristics and functionality of a single switch, while adding an increased number of ports. Stacks quickly increase the capacity of a network.

As project manager, I choose the waterfall methodology model as this is a straightforward, well-define project management methodology suitable with a well-define goal that will not change. The waterfall model consists of 6 phases: Requirements, system design, Implementation, Integration and testing. Deployments of system and maintenance. This is a common model to follow with projects such this it has clearly defined stages that begin when the preceding stage ends.
The Requirements phase of this project was satisfied by gathering relevant stakeholders from across the company. These meetings discusses the current state of the network, past issues, the issues to overcome and a plan for future growth. This lead directly in the system design phase, where based on the information gathered, a new network design was developed to include number of switches needed, the performance of those switches, and how they will be configured.
The implementation phase began by generating a list of equipment needed from the system design phase and ordering the equipment from the companies preferred supplier. This equipment was delivered to the receiving department in building 2 and grouped according to installation location. Once this equipment was received and added to the IT asset inventory, it was unboxed and configured according to the destination and network best practices according to Cisco. 
The Integration and Test phase began by installing the new core switch alongside the current hardware and verifying connectivity with the existing firewall and internet. Once connectivity tests were successful System Deployment System Deployment phase commenced and new equipment was installed at each buildings MDF. New equipment was powered up and connected to the network backbone. Once connectivity with the core was established the endpoint devices such as printers and client computers were connected. After endpoint devices were verified, the next IDF was connected and repeated until each building was on the new network. Verification of endpoint devices included test prints, connecting to the internet, traceroute and ping, and verify IP-cameras were recording, and shop floor terminals would connect to the MRP database.
Once verified this brought us to the Maintenance phase of the project, which included the monitoring and preventive maintenance (PMI) of the new network equipment.

Goal 1: Network design and upgrade. Create a new network design and replace all obsolete and end-of-life hardware. Completing this goal entailed designing an efficient, robust network, selecting a single hardware manufacture for networking hardware, was qualified by increased network throughput, stability, and ease of management. This was the projects primary goal consisting of four supporting objectives.
Objective 1. a. – Inventory and document existing network equipment. This was mainly needed for the number of switches, port counts and evaluating the network’s future growth. One of the main problems with the current network was that it was a “flat” network with no IP security or IP segmentation or VLANs. Therefore, the current design of the network was not needed. This objective was met when an inventory of the existing network equipment was complete along with the documentation, labeling and testing of all the fiber optic cabling preformed
	Objective 1. b. Design new network and order hardware. The next step in this process was to create a new network design for the company. This network design was created to be secure, redundant and adhere to industry practices. Based on the design, an equipment list was created, ordered, and received at building 2.
Objective 1. c. Configure network switches. All network hardware was shipped to building 2. Upon arrival all equipment was inventoried and tagged the IT department then configured. The equipment was then grouped by building location then powered up to verify functionality.
Objective 1. d. Install network switches and preform end-to-end connectivity checks. Fortunately for B & B, the rack they had the existing equipment was installed in was an oversized 52U and this allowed for the new equipment to be installed alongside the old switches. This enabled both old and new to be running in tandem and allowed the new switches to be connected to the internet. Between each building there was an old set of Ethernet cables which was marked as “do not use” and this served as an easy method in which to pull the new fiber lines through. As the new fiber was run and connected connectivity checks were done by all wired devices such as desktop computers and cameras.
Goal 2: Improve network management. The next goal was targeted at improving the management and helping with troubleshooting issues at the network level. “We usually reactive to network issues instead of proactive, and tend to put out fires instead of preventing them” the on-site IT manager said. This was accomplished by a single objective and was qualified by being able to monitor and manage the network from the IT department.
