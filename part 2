Proposal Overview 
B&B Manufacturing is a medium-sized company of 275 employees located in Valencia, CA. The company consists of 5 adjacent buildings including administration, assembly, manufacturing, and maintenance. Their network is a mix of multi-vendor hardware that lacks standardization, and network separation and it includes equipment that has been deemed end-of-life by the manufacturer. Since the Biden Administration has pushed to bring more manufacturing jobs back to America, the company has seen tremendous growth. Because of this, employees have complained about slow connections to on premise resources such as file stores ERP systems, and Wi-Fi.  Along with this growth the company has also stated they want to replace an aging phone system with an IP-based one.
As a former employee turned managed service provider (MSP) I was chosen to assist with documenting, proposing, standardizing, procuring, and upgrading the network infrastructure. This process included creating a network diagram of the current network infrastructure, discussing future technology with upper management and on-site IT staff suggesting future expansion such as the desired IP phone system, then proposing and installing a solution that will meet both requirements from a single manufacturer. Once the network design and equipment list was approved, the company would requests bids from approved vendors to purchase and installation would take place to install and configure the new network equipment.
	This project began with interviewing the on-site IT staff and upper management to determine the needs and expectations of the network, as well as discussing future growth of the company and IP phone system requirements. While these interviews took place, notes of the existing infrastructure were taken and network topology mapping software was used to probe the existing network to confirm logical topology. Physical inspections of adequate cooling and power, along with fiber connections between buildings. 
At this time, the fiber optic cabling that connects the five buildings were tested and verified to see if it could handle the proposed new network equipment’s transmissions speeds (authors note the connection between 2 and 3 is no good and new lines need to be redone/retrenched). 
Phase 2 of the project consisted of designing the network, including the new IP address schemes and VLANS, and compiling a finalized list of equipment for each building and location. Once this list was complete, it was emailed to various suppliers for pricing for a request for quote (RFQ) during a waiting period of two weeks for best pricing. After a two-week period of pricing had ended quotes were evaluated and the supplier was selected. Once the supplier was selected and the scope of work was determined, the equipment was ordered.
Phase 3 (authors note swap out these phases if they don’t align with task 1 paper) began with receiving, verifying, and configuring the new equipment. The new equipment was powered up and configured at the administration building and installed at the corresponding building locations. 
The process was carried out one building at a time beginning with the core of the network - Building 2 main distribution frame (MDF) then progressing to each intermediate distribution frame (IDF) within the building. Throughout this document, the main distribution frame (MDF) refers to the central connection point for each of the buildings to the rest of the network and IDFs refer to the smaller network closets within the buildings across the corporate campus. The justification for this approach was that it minimized the downtime of each of the buildings and any problems that might arise could be addressed without affecting the rest of the company. (Problem isolation?).

Review of Other work
Migrating and standardizing on a manufacturer for network equipment simplifies the administration and reduces network management overhead. During this process, extensive research was done to search for advice, tips, and similar outcomes to gauge the success of the project. According to Cisco’s_ best practice guide, it is recommended best practice to deploy a two-tier network architecture design or also referred to as leaf and spine because of ____ (Cisco, date). The two-tear network or leaf/spine consists of ___. The leaf layer is the first tier of the campus where end-user devices such as computers, printers, phones, and IP-based cameras connect to the network. The spine or core (?) is where the heart of the network where servers and network storage devices reside. 
	After the physical design of the network was completed, it was time to design the logical layout.  The original network was a flat network meaning it had no IP address security segmentation or Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). A VLAN is a logical group of workstations, servers, and network devices ___ definition from an article hopefully finds how VLANs help with network traffic or speed (Cisco, DATE). Authors note check out the business routers article-
It was determined that B&B would benefit greatly by creating VLANs for similar devices and groups such as servers, IP-based cameras, shops, guests, IT management and future IP-based phones. Per Cisco’s best practices article “Create a “Dead End” VLAN for Unused Ports”(Cisco, 2020) recommendation the default VLAN would be changed and a “dead-end” VLAN would be created to place unused ports in until they are needed. Access control lists (ACLs) would be created as well to either permit or deny access to resources such as printers, servers or devices with confidential information.
	After the information was gathered for the physical and logical design of the new network it was time to look into prioritizing and routing traffic. Since B and B Manufacturing had expressed interest in upgrading to an IP-based phone system in the future it was extremely important to incorporate this into the network design. VoIP calls can be prone to jitter, latency, and packet loss issues which lead to bad audio quality, network congestion, missed or jumbled audio, and dropped calls. (United World Telecom, 2021). Another important aspect to incorporate into the design is QoS or Quality of Service. Network switches normally all traffic the same and with voice traffic, it is very sensitive to delay, jitter and packet loss.
. To do this Cisco’s best practices guide for Quality of Service for Voice over IP was used 

Current Project Environment
	B&B manufacturing had a very fundamental setup. Within Building 2, in the MDF there were 3 NETGEAR unmanaged 24 port JFS524 10/100 switches serving as the “core network”. An unmanaged switch comes with a fixed configuration and does not allow any changes to its configuration. A managed switch allows for better control, and prioritization, of network traffic. Attached to one of these switches was a Linksys SRW2024 power-over-Ethernet (POE) switch connected to the IP-cameras. This same switch had a cat 5 cable going underground via a conduit to building 3. On another of the NETGEAR switches there was a post-it note taped on both ends labeled “to building rear IDF”. On the lowest of the NETGEAR stack, a SonicWALL NSA 220 Firewall was found connected to the internet service provider’s modem. All of these connections were connected via 100 Mbps (megabits per second). In the rear of building 2 found in the IDF there were two more NETGEAR switches connected together with category 5 cable and another Linksys POE switch for cameras. One of these NETGEAR switches had a 100 Mbps (megabits per second) cat 5 cables going underground through the conduit to Building 1. In Building 1’s MDF there were 3 more NETGEAR switches along with 1 of the same Linksys POE switches. One of the NETGEAR switches went out to two IDFs and another went through the underground conduit to building 4 and then to two IDFs within its building. Each IDF contained the same number of switches found in the MDF. In building 4 was a direct copy of building 1 with the same number of devices in each IDF and MDFs. Exploring Building 3, 3 more NETGEAR and 1 Linksys POE were found along with a conduit to Building 5. Once again building 5 contained the same quantity and manufacturer of switches all connected via the same speed of 100 Mbps. Although this equipment was still functioning, the network was fully saturated and running as capacity and could not keep up with the volume of devices and growth over the last few years.
The current network design was a flat network with no IP segmentation or security. The problem with this setup is that if a broadcast packet is sent out from an end device in building 1, that broadcast packet is sent to every building and network device connected to the network. One of the issues in the past the On-site IT staff mentioned is that they had experienced a network loop and had crashed the company network and taken it down for a few days. A network loop is caused when a patch cable gets plugged in from one network port directly to another. This causes the packets to reflect back to the source in which locks up the switch.
The issue with lack of network segmentation is that when a customer or supplier joins the network to do a presentation any malicious software or virus that could be present on their computer could inflect the entire company. 


The new equipment installed in building 2 consists of 5 Cisco POE switches configured in a stack configuration. Some network switches have the ability to be connected to other switches and operate together as a single unit. These configurations are called stacks. Stacking shows the characteristics and functionality of a single switch, while adding an increased number of ports. Stacks quickly increase the capacity of a network. (Cisco Business: Glossary of New Terms, 2020)


The Proposal Overview section (suggested length of 2–4 pages) introduces the problem and overviews the solution. It contains the "road map" for the rest of the paper. First, describe the problem the project addresses and then provide an overview of the project and the paper's organization. Finally, summarize the capstone's highlights. Include the following in your summary:
The proposed 
A.1 Problem Summary
B and B Manufacturing has seen rapid growth and because of this the network has become strained and users have complained about network slowness. Prior to the company’s growth B and B’s network has not seen any changes for over 13 years. When interviewing the stakeholders it was revealed that they had been wanting to upgrade their aging phone system with an IP-based one but due to budgetary reasons only the network will be upgraded at this time.
#Summaries of the problem should include the context in which this problem exists. Summarize what will and will not be included in the project. Provide sufficient background information so that the reader can appreciate the need for a solution and the approach taken in the project.
A.2 IT Solution
#Describe the proposed IT solution to the problem. Identify the relationship between the problem and the proposed solution.
During the meeting with stakeholders it was proposed, once a assessment was taken place,  to replace all Ethernet-connected switches with redundant fiber-connected connections between buildings for the backbone with all endpoints like computers and printers with new category 6 cable. 



A.3 Implementation Plan 
This is how it’s going to be installed? Need to add more to this
(read this for ideas: https://github.com/ashejim/C769/blob/main/resources/examples/BSCIA/example_task2-bscia-a.pdf
)
I will start by assessing the current switches install across all buildings. B &B Manufacturing will provide a list of all network switches currently in place including their network information, make, model, and location. After the current environment is mapped the different manufacturers will be examined and a single manufacturer will be determined. By standardizing on a single manufacturer for network equipment simples the administration and network management overhead.

As the project manager, I choose the waterfall methodology model as this is a straightforward, well-defined project management methodology suitable with a well-defined goal that will not change. The waterfall model consists of 6 phases: Requirements, system design, Implementation, Integration, and testing. Deployments of system and maintenance. This is a common model to follow with projects such as this it has clearly defined stages that begin when the preceding stage ends.
The Requirements phase of this project was satisfied by gathering relevant stakeholders from across the company. These meetings discussed the current state of the network, past issues, the issues to overcome, and a plan for future growth. This led directly to the system design phase, where based on the information gathered, a new network design was developed to include the number of switches needed, the performance of those switches, and how they will be configured.
The implementation phase began by generating a list of equipment needed from the system design phase and ordering the equipment from the company’s preferred supplier. This equipment was delivered to the receiving department in building 2 and grouped according to the installation location. Once this equipment was received and added to the IT asset inventory, it was unboxed and configured according to the destination and network best practices according to Cisco. 
The Integration and Test phase began by installing the new core switch alongside the current hardware and verifying connectivity with the existing firewall and internet. Once connectivity tests were successful System Deployment phase commenced and new equipment was installed at each building’s MDF. New equipment was powered up and connected to the network backbone. Once connectivity with the core was established the endpoint devices such as printers and client computers were connected. After endpoint devices were verified, the next IDF was connected and repeated until each building was on the new network. Verification of endpoint devices included test prints, connecting to the internet, traceroute and ping, and verifying IP-cameras were recording, and shop floor terminals would connect to the MRP database.
#do not do below this is beyond the scope of work
#Once verified this brought us to the Maintenance phase of the project, which included the monitoring and preventive maintenance (PMI) of the new network equipment.

	Thake phases mentioned in part 1 and translate these goals
Goal 1: Network design and upgrade. Create a new network design and replace all obsolete and end-of-life hardware. Completing this goal entailed designing an efficient, robust network, and selecting a single hardware manufacturer for networking hardware, which was qualified by increased network throughput, stability, and ease of management. This was the project’s primary goal consisting of four supporting objectives.
Objective 1. a. – Inventory and document existing network equipment. This was mainly needed to determine the number of switches, ports and evaluate the network’s future growth. One of the main problems with the current network was that it was a “flat” network with no IP security or IP segmentation or VLANs. Therefore, the current design of the network was not needed and thus needed to be redesigned. This objective was met when an inventory of the existing network equipment was complete along with the documentation, labeling and testing of all the fiber optic cabling performed
	Objective 1. b. Design new network and order hardware. The next step in this process was to create a new network design for the company. This network design was created to be secure, redundant, and adhere to industry practices. Based on the design, an equipment list was created, ordered, and received at Building 2.
Objective 1. c. Configure network switches. All network hardware was shipped to building 2. Upon arrival, all equipment was inventoried and tagged by the IT department and then configured. The equipment was then grouped by building location then powered up to verify functionality. Once the equipment was configured prior to installation they were connected and through testing was conducted.
Objective 1. d. Install network switches and perform end-to-end connectivity checks. Fortunately for B & B, the rack they had the existing equipment installed in was an oversized 52U and this allowed for the new equipment to be installed alongside the old switches. This enabled both old and new to be running in tandem and allowed the new switches to be connected to the internet. Between each building there was an old set of Ethernet cables that was marked as “do not use” and this served as an easy method through which to pull the new fiber lines through. As the new fiber was run and connected connectivity checks were completed by wired devices such as desktop computers and printers.
Objective X.a. Verify network documentation. Once the new networking equipment was installed and functioning properly, documentation on the network design along with IP and VLAN configurations were verified and stored safely. 
This documentation was stored along with IP addresses, VLAN configurations, and passwords was stored in a fireproof safe in the IT department’s office. 
During this project, there were two obstacles that caused the project to take longer than expected. The first problem was discovered when the fiber was installed between building 2 and 3. During this phase, it was discovered that the ground conduit had collapsed and the cable could not be pulled through. To rectify this, the concrete had to be removed, the conduit repaired, and buried back in the ground. The next issue did not affect the timeline very much as it was discovered the circuit and ISP modem had to be upgraded to support the new speeds on the inside of the company otherwise this would become a choke point in the network. This was simply a phone call to the ISP and the new hardware was sent out and an ISP technician arrived to install the new equipment during the same time the equipment was being installed throughout the switch install phase.
Unanticipated Requirements
	While installing the fiber cabling backbone between buildings it was discovered over time that the underground line connecting building 2 and 3 had been crushed. Once this was discovered the conduit line had to be unburied repaired and then covered up and new cement poured. This delayed the project caused a delay in the project by 2 weeks because the cabling was over a frequently used driveway but did not cause any issues with the budget. 
The unanticipated requirement was when it was discovered that the ISP modem and circuit needed to be upgraded to allow for the new bandwidth needs of the company. Since this was discovered during the beginning of the installation phase this did not affect the schedule as this upgrade took place at the same time. As for the circuit and modem upgrade, this was at no cost to the customer as this was included with the business internet plan. 
Conclusions 
The success of this project was determined by the positive and helpful response from the administrative and on-site IT staff. Another determining factor is that not a single network crash or slowdown – even during peak business hours- had occurred since the installation of the new equipment. Administrative staff had commented on how the network shares did not “hesitate” when opening frequently used folders like it previously did. Shop floor and tool crib attendants commented on how quicker and more responsive the MRP system felt.
